when we consider a vb.net program it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's method 
Lets now briefly look into what do class, object, methods and instance variable mean

								OBJECTS

Object have state and behaviours. example: a dog has state color, name, breed, as well as behaviour:wagging,backing,eating etc
an object is an instance of a class 

								CLASS

a class can be defined as a template/blue print that describes the behaviours/states that objects of its type supports

								METHODS

a method is basically a behaviour. a clss cn contin many methods. it is in methods where the logics are written data is mnuopulaed and all the actions are executed 

							INSTANCE VARIABLES

each object has its unique set of instance variables. an object's state is created by values assigned to these instance vriables  


							
							
							IDENTIFIERS	
	
an identifier is a name used to identify a class,variable,functions or any user defined item. the basic rule for running classes in vb.net are as follows:
- a name must beggin with a letter that could be followed by a sequence of letters,digits(0-9) or underscore(_) . the first character in an identifier can not be a digit 
-it must not contain anny embedded space or symbol like ?,-,+,@,!,#,%,^,[] and /. however an _ can be used 
-it should not be a reserved keyword 

							DATA TYPES

a data type reffers to an extensive system used to declare varibles or functions of different types , thetype of a varible determined how muchspace it occupied in storageand how the bits pttern stored is interpreted.

VARIABLES

a variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. each variable in vb.net has a specific type, whichdetermines the siwe and layout of the variable's memory; the range of vlues that can be stored within the memory and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable
