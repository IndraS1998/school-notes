CHAPTER ONE : Segmentation

within the computer system, the os handles all types of jobs b it hardware related, software related , or both. if memory has to be properly managed within a computer system, then there is a need for partitioning, paging and segmentation. 

1.1 partitioning paging and segmentation

partitioning in the context of os is the act of sharing memory locations into different portions called segments wc cn b used by different processes eunning within the computer system. On the other hand, segmantation is the act of allocatingnon contiguous memory locations to different programs(processes) within the computer system . with segmenttion, memory allocation is not shared evenly moungst the various processes running .
