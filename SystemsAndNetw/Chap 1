CHAPTER ONE : Segmentation

within the computer system, the os handles all types of jobs b it hardware related, software related , or both. if memory has to be properly managed within a computer system, then there is a need for partitioning, paging and segmentation. 

1.1 partitioning, paging and segmentation

partitioning in the context of os is the act of sharing memory locations into different portions called segments wc cn b used by different processes eunning within the computer system. On the other hand, segmantation is the act of allocatingnon contiguous memory locations to different programs(processes) within the computer system . with segmentation, memory allocation is not shared evenly moungst the various processes running . /*virtual memory lookup dude*/ with paging, memory allocation within the computer system is done evenly irrespective of the number of sub-processes within a given process . or example, if a memory size is 2gig within a computer sys nd there are 4 processes running , Each of these processes will be allocated 512mib onlike segmentation wc involves allocating more memory space toprocesses with more sub-processes .
